        <h1>My Interests </h1>

        <h2>Travel </h2>

             <p>Travel is one of my top 3 interests because it is my dream to one day travel the world. I want to go places and learn more about other’s cultures. I want to see the way they dress and the kind of food they eat. Road trips and being on the plane are my favorite because I can lay back, relax and listen to music without interruptions. </p>

        <h3>Music </h3>

            <p> Another interest of mine is music. Music is my life; I can’t last a day without it. I mostly listen to R&B and pop from all over the world. My playlist is full of songs in Tigrigna, Amharic, Korean, Chinese and Hindi. My all-time favorite singers are The Weeknd, Tamrat Desta (Ethiopian singer),  Thomas Alazar (Eritrean singer), and EXO (Korean/Chinese boy group). </p>

        <h4>Friends</h4>

            <p>Finally, I love hanging out with my friends. I am an introvert and don’t usually like to go out. But when my friends force me to go out, which happens like every day, we always have a good time together. They always push me to step out of my comfort zone and explore new things. Ever friend group has something that they often do together and our thing is playing card games. We carry cards everywhere we go. We play many types of card games such as speed, ;/k90kings’ corner, OG, 13, California speed, slap jack and etc. We plan to learn more card games in the future too. </p>
